# Technologies Used
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript
  - TradingView API

# Usage
Once the 'index.html' file is open in your browser, you'll see an interactive TradingView chart. The chart shows the BTC/USDT trading pair by default and includes various options for users to interact with, such as changing the time interval, adding technical studies, or switching to a different cryptocurrency pair.
 
 # Customization
You can customize the TradingView widget by editing the 'index.js' file. Here are some things you can change:

- Change the Trading Symbol:
  - Modify the 'symbol' property to adjust the chart's time frame. For example, change '"BINANCE: BTCUSDT"' to '"BINANCE: ETHUSDT"' to show Ethereum instead of Bitcoin.
- Adjust the Time Interval:
  - Change the 'interval' property to adjust the chart's time frame. For example, use '"60"' for a 1-hour or '"D"' for a daily chart.
- Switch Themes:
  - Change the 'theme' property to '"light"' for a light theme or '"dark"' for a dark theme.
- Add Technical Indicators:
  - Modify the 'studies' array to include different technical studies, such as '"STD;EMA"' for an Exponential Moving Average.
